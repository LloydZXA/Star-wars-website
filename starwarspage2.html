    <p class = "Description">The Armored Assault Tank Mk I, otherwise known as the AAT-1, manufactured by Baktoid Armor Workshop, was the Confederacy of Independent Systems' primary infantry vehicle used during the Clone Wars against the Galactic Republic. It was a relatively small, compact, 9.19 meter long tank, and consisted of a heavily armored, spade-shaped lower hull topped with a lighter, secondary hull and rotating turret. It was operated by a crew of four, one B1 pilot battle droid, two gunners, and one commander,[2] which could differ between an OOM command battle droid,[10] tactical droid,[11] or even an organic,[12] and could carry up to six additional droids via handholds and footholds on the hull, as well as ten metric tons. The AAT-1, due to its heavy armor, was neither quick nor agile on the battlefield, boasting a maximum speed of 55 kilometers per hour.</p>

    <p class="Description">Formally identified in background material as the NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer, these tanks are manufactured by the Techno Union and primarily used by the Corporate Alliance, which sides with the Separatists during the Clone Wars. This 10.9 m (36 ft)-long tank is designed to function on its own with a built-in droid brain, though it can also be controlled by a pilot battle droid. Consisting of a huge central tread and forward-mounted outriggers, the tank droid can cross almost any terrain with ease and achieve a top speed of 60 km/h (37 mph). Its weaponry includes two heavy repeating blasters, two ion cannons, and missile launchers.</p>
