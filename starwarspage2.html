    <p class = "description">The Armored Assault Tank Mk I, otherwise known as the AAT-1, manufactured by Baktoid Armor Workshop, was the Confederacy of Independent Systems' primary infantry vehicle used during the Clone Wars against the Galactic Republic. It was a relatively small, compact, 9.19 meter long tank, and consisted of a heavily armored, spade-shaped lower hull topped with a lighter, secondary hull and rotating turret. It was operated by a crew of four, one B1 pilot battle droid, two gunners, and one commander,[2] which could differ between an OOM command battle droid,[10] tactical droid,[11] or even an organic,[12] and could carry up to six additional droids via handholds and footholds on the hull, as well as ten metric tons. The AAT-1, due to its heavy armor, was neither quick nor agile on the battlefield, boasting a maximum speed of 55 kilometers per hour.</p>

    <p class = "description">Hailfire droids are mobile missile platforms that appear in Attack of the Clones during the Battle of Geonosis and have featured in other Star Wars media associated with the Clone Wars. In-universe material identifies them as IG-227 Hailfire-class droid tanks produced by Haor Chall Engineering and commissioned for the InterGalactic Banking Clan prior to the Clone Wars to assist with debt collection. Standing 6.8 m (22 ft) tall and capable of 45 km/h (28 mph), they consist of two large wheels with a low-fixed base on which is mounted a targeting photoreceptor, twin chin-mounted blaster cannons, and two missile launchers. Each launcher can carry up to 15 missiles, which have an effective range of less than one kilometre following deliberately evasive trajectories to their target. Although an effective platform against both ground and air targets, the Hailfire was phased out during the Clone Wars because of its limited ammunition supply.</p>

    <p class="description">Formally identified in background material as the NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer, these tanks are manufactured by the Techno Union and primarily used by the Corporate Alliance, which sides with the Separatists during the Clone Wars. This 10.9 m (36 ft)-long tank is designed to function on its own with a built-in droid brain, though it can also be controlled by a pilot battle droid. Consisting of a huge central tread and forward-mounted outriggers, the tank droid can cross almost any terrain with ease and achieve a top speed of 60 km/h (37 mph). Its weaponry includes two heavy repeating blasters, two ion cannons, and missile launchers.</p>

    <p class="description">The HMP Droid gunship is the Separatist counterpart to the Republic's LAAT, the Heavy Missile Platform droid gunship (or HMP Predator) is a heavily armed repulsorlift airspeeder which can be adapted for a wide range of mission profiles. Mass-produced by Baktoid Fleet Ordnance on numerous worlds, the HMP is controlled by an advanced droid brain and measures 12.4 m (41 ft) long, 11 m (36 ft) wide and 3.1 m (10 ft) high. The gunship possesses a top speed of 600 km/h (370 mph). However it is considered relatively slow and with average maneuverability, compensated for by its ability to unleash incredible firepower and strong deflector shields. Its weaponry can be changed out depending on what's needed, but standard armament includes a chin-mounted medium laser cannon, two twin laser cannon turrets, wingtip-mounted light laser cannons, and fourteen missiles fitted with variable payloads including high explosive, EMP, incendiary and hard radiation.[57] The gunship can also be modified to serve as a troop carrier for battle droids.</p>

    <p class="description">The Multi-Troop Transport (MTT) was a heavily armored repulsorlift transport vehicle manufactured by Baktoid Armor Workshop and used by both the Trade Federation during their Invasion of Naboo and later the Confederacy of Independent Systems to transport B1-series battle droids before and during the Clone Wars. During the Clone Wars, it was used to transport B2-series super battle droids. The Multi-Troop Transport was a heavy, broad-shouldered, snub-nosed repulsorlift vehicle designed to transport battle droids into combat. Massive, lumbering, imposing vehicles, the 35.94 meter long and 10.45 meter tall MTT was considered a troop carrier, a tank, and a siege ram. It was difficult to stop at a maximum speed of thirty-one kilometers per hour and when compared to the Armored Assault Tank also used by the Federation and Confederacy, it was extremely capable in its role.</p>
