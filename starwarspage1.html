    <p class = "description">The All Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE), nicknamed "six legs" by the Separatist Droid Army, was a multipurpose military ground walker and tank used by the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. It had six legs, six laser cannon turrets along the body and a heavy projectile mass-driver cannon on the top of the walker. It was one of the main ground vehicles for the Grand Army of the Republic throughout the Clone Wars.</p>

    <p class="description">The turbo tank is a ten-wheeled battle tank and armored personnel carrier that appears in Revenge of the Sith and is based on designs done by Joe Johnston for use in The Empire Strikes Back.[44] West End Games based their "HAVw A5 Juggernaut" design on Johnson's sketches. The larger, more heavily armed vehicle that appears in Revenge of the Sith is labeled "HAVw A6". The clone turbo tank, more formally the HAVw A6 Juggernaut, is described in Star Wars sources as being built by Kuat Drive Yards to serve as a heavily armed and armored military transport for the Republic during the Clone Wars.[45][46] Measuring 49.4 m (162 ft) long, 19.6 m (64 ft) wide and 30.4 m (100 ft) high, the massive tank can carry as many as 300 clone troopers into battle depending on internal configuration. Each of the Juggernaut's ten wheels consists of three independently spinning segments and utilize independent suspension to travel across nearly any terrain.[47] Designed to absorb enemy fire, they help the tank achieve a maximum speed of 160 km/h (99 mph).[45] A crew of 12 operates the Juggernaut and can control it from cockpits located at either end of the tank.[45][47] The Juggernaut's nearly impregnable armor plating is thermally superconductive to absorb and spread heat over a wider area. For weaponry it is equipped with a heavy laser cannon turret and rapid-repeating heavy laser cannon turret on the roof; two side-mounted medium antipersonnel laser cannons that extend out from either side of the hull; two twin antipersonnel blaster cannons under the 'forward' cockpit; and two retractable rocket/grenade launchers</p>

    <p class="description">The Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry (LAAT/i), also referred to as the Republic Gunship, Republic attack gunship, Assault Gunship or LAATi,and nicknamed a larty,was one of the several models in the Low Altitude Assault Transport line of starships that mainly served as gunships and troop transports for the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. Its role was to transport Clone troopers as well as offering air-to-ground and air-to-air support for the Galactic Republic against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The gunship saw extensive use in numerous battles and campaigns of the Clone Wars.</p>

    <p class="description">The Low Altitude Assault Transport/carrier, known more simply as the LAAT/c, was a vehicle carrier variant of Rothana Heavy Engineering's Low Altitude Assault Transport series of repulsorlift gunships developed for the Grand Army of the Republic. Beginning with the First Battle of Geonosis in 22 BBY, the LAAT/c saw use throughout the Clone Wars between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems and in the years afterward. Manned by a single pilot, the LAAT/c was originally designed to deploy All Terrain Tactical Enforcers onto battlefields, though it was soon modified to accommodate a number of additional vehicles as the Clone Wars progressed, using powerful magnetic clamps to hold payloads in place. The LAAT/c shared the same rear-wing configuration common to all LAAT gunships, though it lacked the undercarriage that the more common Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry used to carry clone troopers into battle, and also lacked the heavy armament of its cousins.</p>

    <p class="description">The Self-Propelled Heavy Artillery Turbolaser (SPHA-T), also known as the Self-Propelled Heavy Artillery (SPHA), was a 12-legged gun platform manufactured by Rothana Heavy Engineering. They were the largest ground based weapons used by the Grand Army of the Republic in the Clone Wars. Combining the devastating firepower of a permanent laser cannon emplacement with the ability to liberally walk into battle on powerful articulated legs, the Self-Propelled Heavy Artillery Turbolaser (SPHA-T), also known as the Self-Propelled Heavy Artillery (SPHA), were the largest ground based weapons in the arsenal of the Grand Army of the Republic at 140.2 meters in length. It only used its twelve legs when maneuvering between firing positions; when attacking an enemy target, a SPHA-T remained motionless to give its gunners added precision for aiming its extraordinarily heavy turbolaser beam. Although it took no less than 30 specialized clone troopers to man each gun platform, they were powerful and effective enough to blast through starship shields and hulls. However, SPHA-Ts could only be charged up to a certain level.</p>
